Federated Learning Across Cloud–Edge–End–Edge–Cloud
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Federated Learning (FL) architecture across a hierarchical distributed system:

Cloud Server ↔ Edge Server ↔ End Devices ↔ Edge ↔ Cloud

The system enables privacy-preserving distributed model training without sharing raw data. Instead of centralizing data, model parameters are exchanged between layers.

This architecture is designed for:

Edge AI systems
IoT networks
Raspberry Pi clusters
Privacy-sensitive applications
Spam detection & text classification
